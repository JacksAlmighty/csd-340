        <h2>Chapter 1: My Life</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">I live in Loveland, Colorado, but I used to live in Littleton, Colorado. <span class="sentence">I really enjoy skiing and playing video games in my free time.</span> I also like to go hiking whenever I can.</p>

        <p>I work at Target as a deli and bakery clerk, which gives me a chance to meet lots of different people every day. I enjoy being part of a team and learning new skills on the job. My coworkers and I often share tips and tricks to make the workday easier and more fun.</p>

        <p>My family is very important to me. I am engaged and excited to be getting married in November. I have two dogs and three cats, and they always keep life lively and entertaining at home.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I like to explore the outdoors and go on adventures. Skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer are some of my favorite activities. I also enjoy relaxing with video games when the weather isnâ€™t ideal for outdoor activities.</p>
